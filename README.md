# 🧐 Cyte

🚧 Work in progress - this is beta software, use with care

A background screen recorder for easy history search. 
If you choose to supply an OpenAI key, or a local language model like LLaMA, it can act as a knowledge base. Be aware that transcriptions will be sent to OpenAI when you chat if you provide an OpenAI API key.

## Uses

### 🧠 Train-of-thought recovery

Autosave isn’t always an option, in those cases you can easily recover your train of thought, a screenshot to use as a stencil, or extracted copy from memories recorded.

### 🌏 Search across applications

A lot of research involves collating information from multiple sources; internal tools like confluence, websites like wikipedia, pdf and doc files etc; When searching for something we don’t always remember the source (or it's at the tip of your tongue)

## Features

> - When no OpenAI key is supplied, and browser context awareness is disabled, Cyte is completely private, data is stored on disk only, no outside connections are made
> - Pause/Restart recording easily
> - Set applications that are not to be recorded (while taking keystrokes)
> - Chat your data; ask questions about work you've done

## Development

Happy to accept PRs related to any of the following

### Issues

- App sandbox is disabled to allow file tracking; [instead should request document permissions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70972475)
- Some results from searching fail to highlight the result snippet
- Keyboard navigation events: Return to open selected episode, escape to pop timeline view
- Apply object recognition per frame
- Test automation
- Unit tests for Memory
- Sync between Cytes
- Chat this episode
- Split episodes
- iPad support
